# 🎄 Timeless: The Digital Snow Globe

> "Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind."

## 📖 The Story

Welcome to **Timeless: The Digital Snow Globe**, a heartfelt journey through the essence of Christmas. This interactive 3D experience reminds us that technology may evolve, but the warmth and joy of the holiday season endure. As you travel through three distinct eras—Past, Present, and Future—the visuals transform, yet the glowing tree at the center remains a constant beacon of hope and love.

Inspired by the timeless spirit of the holidays, this project serves as a digital memory box, capturing the magic that unites us all. Regardless of culture, religion, or time, the light of the holidays brings us together. No matter how much time passes, Christmas is a joy for anyone who celebrates it. It is the time when lights litter the streets and children wait in wonder for the loving gifts they would get. A tradition that embraces all in the cold winter months. And hopefully, something that would not change even as we move on to the future.

## 👻 The Three Spirits (Audio Experience)

We used ElevenLabs AI to bring three distinct narrators to life, guiding you through the eras like the Ghosts of Christmas in Dickens' tale:

* **The Past (Father Christmas):** An ancient, weary, but warm voice. He remembers the old ways—candles flickering in the quiet, the simplicity of handwritten letters, and the gentle hush of snowfall.

* **The Present (Santa Claus):** The jolly, energetic, "Coca-Cola" Santa. He embodies the noise, excitement, and vibrant colors of today's celebrations, from bustling markets to festive lights.

* **The Future (Mrs. Claus):** A calm, nurturing, ethereal voice. She whispers of a digital tomorrow where the care and love of the season persist, watching over us like a guiding star.

## 🕹️ How to Experience It

   - **2099 Neon:** Futuristic, glowing hues hinting at a high-tech holiday.

3. **Pixel Art Nostalgia:** The entire 3D scene is rendered with a retro pixelated shader, blending cutting-edge tech with the charm of old-school video games to trigger fond memories.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
